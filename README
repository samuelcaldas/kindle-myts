This is a terminal for kindle based on http://my.svgalib.org/kindle/myts-8.zip.
It contains various fixes and preferences so that it is convenient to use as a
primary display device.

This fork uses statically linked musl as libc. This way the development is very
easy: just compile it on a raspberry pi and then copy the resulting binary to
the device.

Original README follows:

myts -- A kindle based terminal
Matan Ziv-Av (matan@svgalib.org)

A terminal for the kindle, which uses the two parts above,
and simple framebuffer routines, to run a full terminal.

To use the program, you should have launchpad installed.

Shift T T opens terminal 1, or returns to it if already open.
Shift T Y opens terminal 2, or returns to it if already open.
Shift T U opens terminal 3, or returns to it if already open.
Shift T A kills myts


To exit from a terminal press "Left<" (page back on the
top left ; this is configurable).

The keyboard is mapped as follows:


Menu:
F1 F2 F3 F4 F5 F6 F7 F8 F9  F10
`  %  ^  <  >  [  ]  =  F11 F12
\t ;  ,  (  )  {  }
   
   
Back:
!  @  #  $  %  ^  &  *  (   )
'  +  #  -  _  (  )  &  !   ?
~  $  |  /  \  "  '  :

The mapping of the Symbols keyboard (Back), can be configured
by the option Symbols in myts.ini.

The terminal supports UTF8 by using Encoding = UTF8 in the 
config file. Only the first 4096 characters of the font are used 
in this case.
New 8bit encodings can be created by the script codepage.sh in the
source, or by adding the encoding name (iconv format) in the 
CODEPAGES variable in the Makefile.

This program is based on kiterm by Luigi Rizzo, with 
work by mobileread users PoP, Xqtftqx and dsmid.

The regular font is GNU unifont (with characters of width 16 removed)
and the bold font is the 8x13B font from
http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs-fonts.html
Fonts can be converted from bdf to hex format by the
included perl script bdf2hex.
Maximum supported font width is 8. Font width and height must be
configured in myts.ini.
